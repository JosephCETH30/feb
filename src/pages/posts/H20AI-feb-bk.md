At H2O.ai, democratizing AI isn’t just an idea. It’s a movement. And that means that it requires action. We started out as a group of like minded individuals in the open source community, collectively driven by the idea that there should be freedom around the creation and use of AI.

Today we have evolved into a global company built by people from a variety of different backgrounds and skill sets, all driven to be part of something greater than ourselves. Our partnerships now extend beyond the open-source community to include business customers, academia, and non-profit organizations.

### Community Powered
<br>
Our beginnings as a grassroots effort means we are a community powered organization - a community of open source contributors, business leaders, nonprofits and academics. We readily respond to development requests from both our open source and closed source communities.
<br><br>

### Freedom to Innovate
<br>
Being community powered is driven by our belief in the freedom to innovate. Math belongs to the world and it should be accessible to people with a variety of skill sets and experiences. We have worked hard to build AI to do AI, providing barrier free access to the power of machine learning.
<br><br>

### Customer Empathy
<br>
Working closely with the community and our customers gives us great empathy for those we work with. If additional functionality is needed to help you achieve your goals, we're going to co-innovate right beside you. We want to do everything in our power to help you succeed.
<br><br>

### Do Good
<br>
We embrace the idea that we should use our knowledge and experience for good, so responsible development and model transparency are corporate level initiatives for us. We regularly seek out opportunities in our communities where we can make a positive impact with AI.
